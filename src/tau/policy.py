"""A basic safety guard for tool calls.

The guard runs in ``AgentSession._execute_one`` before a tool executes, so it
sees every call, including custom tools and sub-agent calls. It is a
guardrail, not a sandbox: ``bash`` runs with the process's permissions and a
string check cannot see through a shell. These checks stop the obvious
accidents and make refusals visible to the model; they do not contain a
determined one.
