"""Session persistence: append-only JSONL with a tree-shaped entry history.

Modeled after pi's session format: each entry has an id and refers to its
parent, so messages form a tree whose active branch supplies history for the
next model request. The active leaf is recorded with pointer lines; only the
last pointer in the file matters, which keeps the format append-only.
